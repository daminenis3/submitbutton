# 🔘 Animated Submit Button – HTML & CSS
This project demonstrates a visually engaging animated submit button using only HTML and CSS. The design focuses on creative UI interaction and is ideal for modern web forms, landing pages, or UI experiments.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To create an animated button that visually reacts when hovered, drawing attention and enhancing the overall user experience — without using JavaScript or external libraries.

## ✨ Key Features
📌 Built with pure HTML and CSS (no JavaScript)

📦 Lightweight and fast to load

🎞️ Uses span elements to generate a 3D animation effect

🧱 Responsive design

🎯 Centered layout for standalone viewing or easy integration

🎨 Customizable styles for color, size, and animation

## 📂 Files Included
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the button

style.css: Contains all the styling, animation logic, and layout control

## 🧩 How It Works
index.html
A <button> element contains 120 <span> tags inside.

Each <span> represents a small animated line that contributes to the ripple/line effect.

The button is labeled "Submit" using a <p> tag inside the button.

style.css
CSS grid or flexbox centers the button on screen.

Animation is handled using @keyframes to stagger the entry of each span on hover.

CSS nth-child() selector is used to delay and style each span uniquely.

## 🚀 How to Use
